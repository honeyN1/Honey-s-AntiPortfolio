I've made anti-portfolio. This is a 2 page website. I developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The thext content you read on the website was generated with the help of LLM to make this project Fun learning experience. I used this project as an opportunity to learn new things. I have used keyframes, hover effect and css animations throughout the project. I have used lill bit of JS. For thhe skills sections. I have used LLMs as source of learning. I had so many creative ideas but II didnt knew how to implement it like the emoji in the experience section. So, I used LLM of find new ways of implementing it.
